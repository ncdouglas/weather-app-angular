I built this application with the help of the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psZXU8PTAS8. However I did switch the API used to WeatherAPI.com utilizing RapidAPI. I also changed the data displayed from the metric system to imperial, and I switched out some of the displayed data to better fit a US customer base.
